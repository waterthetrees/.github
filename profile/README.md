# [Water The Trees](https://waterthetrees.com)

🌳 [Water The Trees](https://waterthetrees.com) is a platform that crowd sources tree planting and maintenance.
We are an open source project run by tree planting volunteers and [Code for America San Francisco](https://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org/) volunteer software engineers.
We believe in the power of trees to restore natural habitat for animals, insects, and fauna.
We are interested in continuous massive tree planting events to help sequester carbon and stabilize climate change extremes.
